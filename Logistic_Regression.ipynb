        "* Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used to predict the probability that a given input belongs to a particular category, typically binary (e.g., yes/no, spam/not spam).\n",
        "* It uses the sigmoid (logistic) function to map predicted values to a range between 0 and 1, allowing it to output probabilities.\n",
        "* In contrast, Linear Regression is used for regression tasks where the goal is to predict continuous numerical values, such as prices or temperatures, based on input features.\n",
        "* While Linear Regression fits a straight line to the data, Logistic Regression applies a transformation to fit the data into a classification framework.\n",
        "* The key difference lies in their output: Linear Regression predicts numeric values, while Logistic Regression predicts class probabilities.\n",

        "* Sometimes, the model tries too hard to fit every detail, which can make it perform poorly on new data.\n",
        "* Regularization fixes this by adding a penalty to the model when it uses large weights or relies too much on certain features.\n",

        "* Ridge regression, on the other hand, shrinks coefficients of correlated features together but does not perform feature selection.\n",
        "* Elastic Net combines both L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) penalties, allowing it to both select important features and handle correlated variables effectively.\n",

        "* When $\\lambda$ is **large**, the regularization penalty is strong, which forces the model coefficients to be smaller. This helps prevent overfitting by simplifying the model but may lead to **underfitting** if too large.\n",
        "* When $\\lambda$ is **small or zero**, there is little to no regularization, so the model can fit the training data more closely, which may cause **overfitting**.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, $\\lambda$ balances the trade-off between **bias and variance**: higher values increase bias but reduce variance, and lower values reduce bias but increase variance. Proper tuning of $\\lambda$ is essential for good model performance.\n",

        "2. **Independence of Observations**: Each observation is independent of the others.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Linearity of Logit**: The log-odds (logit) of the outcome is a linear combination of the input features. This means the relationship between the predictors and the log-odds is linear.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **No Multicollinearity**: The independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other.\n",
